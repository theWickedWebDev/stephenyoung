    "introduction": [
      "<span class='dropcap'>Hello, my name is Stephen Young and I ___________. I have been coding since middle school when I first learned QBasic which sparked my creative power and I couldn’t stop. I found it thrilling that with this simple program, I could create something out of what seemed like nothing. After a while, I found Visual Basic which brought UI into my world. I just couldnt stop. I later learned HTML and CSS and from there, I grew into what I am today. Backed by all the art classes (painting, Photoshop, cartooning, etc..) I was able to use what I learned from art, and incorporate that into front end coding and design. None of this seemed like it was a skill that I could do as a career until one day someone asked me to make them a website. From there, I started thinking “Can I actually make money coding?” - I made more and more micro sites for small businesses and then attended a bootcamp to learn more of the “product” aspects to apps. From there I got larger contracts and then finally landed my first internship which developed into a full time position.</span>",
      "<span>Today, I am a few jobs in and passionate as ever! I want to find a company whose product resonates with me, not just a job. (etc.)</span>",
      "<span>When I am not working on the computer, learning new skills or making fun web-apps, I am usually found outside. Some of my favorite activities are woodworking in the shop, maintaining a beautiful lawn, being a father of two kids, and taking care of my chickens.</span>",
      "[TODO] I am looking for a tech team to work with that does things 'by the book' - not willy nilly. I want to learn from a well oiled team, one that doest constantly worry about deployments and regressions. One that has well functioning inter-departament communiation and functions."

As a member of the Vsnap dev team Stephen was always happy to pick up any task that needed doing and never shy about working on things that were outside of his comfort zone.
