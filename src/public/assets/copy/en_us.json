    "introduction": [
      "<span class='dropcap'>Hello, my name is Stephen Young and I ___________. I have been coding since middle school when I first learned QBasic which sparked my creative power and I couldn’t stop. I found it thrilling that with this simple program, I could create something out of what seemed like nothing. After a while, I found Visual Basic which brought UI into my world. I just couldnt stop. I later learned HTML and CSS and from there, I grew into what I am today. Backed by all the art classes (painting, Photoshop, cartooning, etc..) I was able to use what I learned from art, and incorporate that into front end coding and design. None of this seemed like it was a skill that I could do as a career until one day someone asked me to make them a website. From there, I started thinking “Can I actually make money coding?” - I made more and more micro sites for small businesses and then attended a bootcamp to learn more of the “product” aspects to apps. From there I got larger contracts and then finally landed my first internship which developed into a full time position.</span>",
      "<span>Today, I am a few jobs in and passionate as ever! I want to find a company whose product resonates with me, not just a job. (etc.)</span>",
      "<span>When I am not working on the computer, learning new skills or making fun web-apps, I am usually found outside. Some of my favorite activities are woodworking in the shop, maintaining a beautiful lawn, being a father of two kids, and taking care of my chickens.</span>",
      "[TODO] I am looking for a tech team to work with that does things 'by the book' - not willy nilly. I want to learn from a well oiled team, one that doest constantly worry about deployments and regressions. One that has well functioning inter-departament communiation and functions."

      "description": "Worked with React, Graphql, Elastic Search, MySql and many other Javascript packages daily. Using Jenkins, Docker and other tools to help our team with deployments, I delivered countless new features and improvements to all of our codebases.<br/><br/>Brought unit testing to our client projects taking advantage of packages such as Enzyme, Jest, Cha, Nightwatch as well as Flow for our static tests. These changes were baked into our git-flow using pre-push and pre-commit hooks.<br/><br/>Collaborated with the Project Manager to define the development process using Kanban as the core. Created new ticket types, improved our swimlanes, and increased the efficiency of our meetings.<br/><br/>Participated in phone screens, interviews, code challenges, and resume reviews in order to help build our technology department.",
