Using Jenkins, Docker and other tools to help us deploy our work, I delivered countless new features and improvements to all of our codebases.<BR/><BR/>I brought unit testing to our client projects taking advantage of packages such as Enzyme, Jest, Cha, Nightwatch as well as Flow for our static tests. These changes were baked into our git-flow using pre-push and pre-commit hooks.<BR/><BR/>I worked closely with the Project Manager to define the development process using Kanban as the core. I helped to create new ticket types, improve our swimlanes and our meeting effectiveness.<BR/>Helped to build our development team by participating and leading phone screens, interviews, code challenges, and resume reviews.",
