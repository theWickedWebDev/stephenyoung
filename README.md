# Blog Post / Pre Interview ideas

talk about remote work and how I do it

be enthusiastic

get to know the company

if you have ideas about what they are doing, and what they should do, it opens up a lot of conversation possibilities

in fact, in a way... interviews are mainly about getting through the 30-60 minutes with each person

you want them to come out feeling like it was positive, and the more you know about them, the easier it is to keep a good chat going

for things that are outside your expertise, turn it into a collaboration, if they are willing

i definitely prefer a candidate to say "i don't know that much about <<specific tech>>, but can we walk through your question together?"
it gives them a chance to see how quickly you can grasp new concepts, which honestly is a better skill to have than any other

i would say, too, that at this point in your career you can be a little more.. choosy
don't try to make yourself fit into someone else's mold

it's counterintuitive, but disagreeing honestly in an interview can be a good thing
sometimes companies are looking for fresh perspective. and people who can bring their ideas effectively, even if they aren't the normal take

---
what would i look out for

"we are building our own cloud platform"
10:43
in fact, the phrase "building our own" followed by "to support [something in the business]"
10:43
is like ptsd trigger for me
